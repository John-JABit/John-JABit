- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m John.
- I am new to Github.
- I have recently started training in IT and specialising in Software Development.

have a go at coding games and found that interesting, but wanted to progress to Developing.
-I did a few free online course's on 'Alison.com' to learn the basics in HTML, CSS. From there,
-I completed a Certificate in Information Technology Essentials(level 4).
